# Advent of Code solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges.

Each year is self-contained in a subfolder of the repository with instructions on how to run the solutions for said year, as programming language and runtimes may differ.

| Edition | Programming language and/or runtime |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 2015\*  | Golang 1.19                         |
| 2019    | TypeScript 3.7 with NodeJS 12       |
| 2020    | Golang 1.15                         |
| 2021    | TypeScript 4.5 with NodeJS 16       |
| 2022    | Golang 1.19                         |
| 2023    | TypeScript 5.3 with NodeJS 18       |

Entries marked with a star have been solved after the competition for that year has ended.
